# Warehouse Defect Analysis â€“ Proof of Concept

This project simulates and analyzes the correlation between environmental conditions (temperature and noise) and defect rates in a warehouse fulfillment process. The goal is to demonstrate how real-time sensor data combined with operational data can be used to identify and validate environmental stressors contributing to order fulfillment errors.
